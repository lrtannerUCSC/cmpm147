Let's make a shitty LEGO City ad together. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl1HcsdVf0w I was inspired by this old LEGO City ad, I'm not really sure why but it was the first thing that came to mind for a text generator. My goal was to make more similar ad scripts like the one in the video but with some more unrealistic and stupid plot lines. For example, a cat that has been taken hostage at a donut shop.
